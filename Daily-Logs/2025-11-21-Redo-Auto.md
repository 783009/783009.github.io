📌 SMART Goal for Today

Specific: I will begin Question 9 by creating the scatterplot matrix for all numerical variables and computing the correlation matrix using .corr(). Then I will run the multiple linear regression model (mpg as response, all other variables except name as predictors) and generate the summary output.

Measurable: I will produce (1) a scatterplot matrix, (2) a correlation matrix table, and (3) the printed regression summary in my notebook.

Achievable: I already have the cleaned dataset and Python tools ready, so this is manageable within one work session.

Relevant: This is essential progress toward completing the Applied Questions and building content for the blog post and GitHub.

Timely: I will complete these tasks by the end of today’s work session and update my Daily Log.
