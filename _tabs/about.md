Circuit project being made by Mohamed Lahkim and Erik for their technology class culminating task.
Plan is to make a laundry machine using a servo three buttons and a rhapberry pi.

### Laundry machine features
#### Start button
The start button will send a PWM signal to the motor when pressed and will run the motor for 10 seconds.

#### Pause button
The laundry machine will have a pause feature. If you click on the start button while the laundry machine is working it will pause and can be continued if you press the button again.

#### Stop button
If you wish for the laundry machine to terminate all activity click the stop button.

#### Speed button
The laundry machine will be equipped with a speed button which will change the PWM signal being sent to the motor and will change the speeds. The laundry machine will have three speeds: Slow, Medium, and fast.

#### Speed LED's
The laundry machine will be equipped with three LED's which tell you which speed the laundry machine is on. If the laundry machine is on the slow speed the green LED will turn on. If the laundry machine is on the medium speed the yellow LED will turn on. If the laundry machine is on the high speed the red LED will turn on

#### Buzzer
The laundry machine will be equiped with a buzzer to let you know when it finishes.

#### Raspberry pi
The raspberry pi will be used to run code (can be found in the "Laundry Machine Code" post) that will deal with all of the logic required.
