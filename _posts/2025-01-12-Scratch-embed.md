# Circuit project on scratch

This is an embed of the circuit project I made on Scratch to simulate what my circuit will be like!

<iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1119305619/embed" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

#### **Start the laundry machine**
Click on the green flag to start. Click on the green start button to start the laundry machine. If you click it again while it is working it will pause the washing and will appear as a red button. Press the button again for it to continue.

#### **Set the power level**
To change the power level of the laundry machine simply click the green button that has low power written on it. That button is diplaying the power level the laundry machine in currentry at. Clicking this button will set the laundry maching to normal power and clicking it again will set it to high power. Click the button once more to set the power level back to low.

#### **Stop the laundry machine**
To stop the laundry machine simply click the stop button. This will terminate all activity done by the machine.

## How embedded my scratch project
This is the code
```html
<iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1119305619/embed" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
```
I used `<iframe` which is an html tag which allows me to embed things from other websites onto my website. I then inputted `src=` which defines source aka the URL. I the proceded to writing out the URL of my scratch project with `/embed` at the end. The next thing on the list is the height and the width which define how tall and how wide the embed will be. `frameborder="0"` removes the default border that would have been there. `allowtransparency="true"` makes sure there are no problems when it comes to rendering images with tranparent backgrounds. Line of code is ended off with `></iframe>` which as i said before is an html tag which allows me to embed things from other websites onto my website.
